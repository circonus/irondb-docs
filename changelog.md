# Changelog

 * Various minor fixes

## Changes in 0.9.5
2017-09-05

 * More efficient Graphite metric parsing

## Changes in 0.9.2
2017-08-04

 * Improve query read speed when synthesizing rollups from raw data
 * Fix double-free crash in handling of series_multi requests

## Changes in 0.9.1
2017-08-01

 * Fix crash in topology handling for clusters of more than 10 nodes
 * Check topology configuration more carefully on initial import
 * Various stability fixes
 * Document network ports and protocols required for operation

## Changes in 0.9.0
2017-07-13

 * Support for parallelizing rollups, which can be activated by adding a
   "rollup" element to the `<pools>` section of `irondb.conf`, with a
   "concurrency" attribute:
    ```
    <pools>
      ...
      <rollup concurrency="N"/>
    </pools>
    ```
   where `N` is an integer in the range from 1 up to the value of `nnt_put`
   concurrency but not greater than 16. If not specified, rollups will remain
   serialized (concurrency of 1). A value of 4 has been shown to provide the
   most improvement over serialized rollups. 
 * Fix for watchdog-panic when fetching large volumes of data via graphite endpoints.
 * Stop stripping NULLs from beginning and end of graphite responses.
 * Do not return graphite metric data from before the start of collection for that metric.
 * Optimization for graphite fetches through the storage finder plugin.
 * Changes to support data ingestion from new irondb-relay.

 * Efficiency improvement in Graphite queries; we now strip NULLs from both ends of the returned response.
 * Fix a bug in Graphite query that would return a closely related metric instead of the requested one.
 * Fix a bug that caused us to request millisecond resolution when zoomed out too far, and 1-day would be better.
 * First draft of a progress UI for reconstitute.

## Changes in 0.8.21
